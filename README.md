This application uses themoviedb.org API, which requires an API key.
Add a gradle.properties file to the project folder (where this file is located).
In the gradle.properties file, add the following key=value pair with your API key:

movieDbApiKey=your_key_goes_here

Once that is done, your key will be used to make the calls to themoviedb.org
